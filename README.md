Uber Trip Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Uber trip data to extract valuable insights regarding trip patterns, distances, and purposes. Using Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly for data visualization, this project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering.

Key Features
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, filled NaNs in the PURPOSE column with "Unknown," and removed duplicate records.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized the distribution of trip purposes.
Analyzed trip distances and trip counts by day of the week.
Feature Engineering: Created new features such as the day of the week (start_day) based on trip start dates.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:

START_DATE: The date and time when the trip started.
MILES: The distance covered during the trip.
PURPOSE: The purpose of the trip (e.g., Meeting, Errand, Unknown).
Project Workflow
Data Cleaning:

Filled missing values in the PURPOSE column.
Removed rows containing NaNs and duplicate entries.
EDA:

Visualized trip purposes using bar charts to understand common reasons for trips.
Analyzed the distribution of trip distances with histograms.
Explored the frequency of trips across days of the week.
Feature Engineering:

Extracted the day of the week from the trip start dates for additional analysis.
Visualizations
Trip Purpose Distribution: Bar chart showing the count of each trip purpose.
Trip Distance Distribution: Histogram analyzing the distance traveled across trips.
Trips by Day of the Week: Bar chart showing the number of trips taken on each day of the week.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas: For data cleaning and manipulation.
Plotly: For interactive data visualizations.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
